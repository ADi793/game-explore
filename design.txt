Technology/Techstacks -
    - React -- as a declarative ui library
    - Chakra ui -- as css library than give us built in components


Vanilla js
    const - 
        we have to write imperative code
        we have to directly mutate the ui
        not same as SPA feels like an app
        as our application grows mutation ui/dom manipulation becomes too complext

Modern day framework and libraries - provide abstraction layer over dom manipulation
    where ui is treated as a function(state)
    - the data inside component is bounded to the markup when the data changes the new markup have been generated....
